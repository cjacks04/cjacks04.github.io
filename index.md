## About Me
Dr. Corey Jackson is an Assistant Professor in the [The Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he co-directs the [Collaborative Computing Group](https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu/), an interdisciplinary research lab that investigates how people interact with sociotechnical systems in the context of science, governance, and public life. His research draws from the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and responsible AI, with a particular emphasis on designing systems that enable greater transparency, accountability, and democratic participation in emerging technologies.

Dr. Jackson’s work explores how non-experts engage in complex technical domains—such as artificial intelligence, environmental monitoring, and digital governance—and how technologies can be reimagined to amplify public understanding and collective oversight. His recent projects include developing community-based AI audit tools, studying the learning behaviors of software developers using generative AI, and collaborating with citizen science groups to enhance participation in environmental justice initiatives.

He has received funding from the National Science Foundation ([HCC](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1755628&HistoricalAwards=false)), the [Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org), the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com), and the [UW-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education](https://research.wisc.edu/funding/) to support research at the convergence of civic technology, data governance, and public sector innovation. His scholarship appears in top venues such as *ACM Conference On Computer-Supported Cooperative Work And Social Computing*, the *Journal of the Association for Information Systems*, and *Computers in Human Behavior* and he regularly reviews for and contributes to interdisciplinary research communities.

At UW–Madison, Dr. Jackson teaches courses in Interaction Design, User Experience, and Digital Information. He also he mentors both undergraduate and graduate students, including several Ph.D. advisees. 

He earned his Ph.D. from [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/), where his dissertation focused on evaluating motivation in digital citizen science. After earning his Ph.D., he was a teaching postdoc in Berkeley's Master's in Data Science ([MIDS](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/)) program. His current work examines how everyday people shape and evaluate algorithmic systems and how we might design computational infrastructure that supports social responsibility, inclusion, and democratic governance.
