## About

Dr. Corey Jackson is an Assistant Professor in the [The Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he co-directs the [Collaborative Computing Group](https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu/). His research draws from the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and responsible AI, with a particular emphasis on designing systems that enable greater transparency, accountability, and democratic participation in emerging technologies.

Dr. Jackson’s work explores how non-experts engage in complex technical domains—such as artificial intelligence, environmental monitoring, and digital governance—and how technologies can be reimagined to amplify public understanding and collective oversight. His recent projects include developing community-based AI audit tools, studying the learning behaviors of software developers using generative AI, and collaborating with citizen science groups to enhance participation in environmental justice initiatives.

He has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and UW–Madison OVCRGE.
